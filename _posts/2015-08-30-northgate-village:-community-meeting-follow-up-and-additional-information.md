On Tuesday, August 25th we had the opportunity to hold an informational meeting about our plan for the Northgate Village development in the northeast neighborhood of University City, MO. We greatly appreciate those that took the time to attend and the many questions and ideas that came up during the course of our conversation. At the suggestion of some in attendance at the meeting, we are pleased to make the following information available to those that attended and to the larger community.

Also, we are working on additional information that was requested by those that were in attendance and we will be posting more details in the near future, so please check back to this site soon for additional detail. This updated information will include a mapping exhibit showing all the selected properties for redevelopment (presently we are finalizing negotiations with a few owners of vacant properties). Again, we wish to remind everyone that our targeted properties are all currently vacant lots and buildings and this development will not create any form of displacement for existing neighborhood residents. Also, additional information will be added pertaining to the lease/purchase program that we will be utilizing on this development.

Should you have any questions or wish to discuss in more detail please contact Aaron Burnett of Bywater Development Group at aaron@bywaterdevelopment.com.

Many thanks for your interest and we look forward to discussing more about this development with the community in the days ahead.
