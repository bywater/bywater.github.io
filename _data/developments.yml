    Bywater is working to develop a new 48 unit senior development in a growing and thriving community of choice in the Oklahoma City metro area. Memorial Pointe will achieve high sustainability standards with a range of green building features, and will employ a broad array of Universal Design measures to meet the long-term accessibility and livability needs of its senior residents. A robust supportive services program will enhance the quality of life for development residents.

    Bywater is collaborating with the City of University City to undertake the next strategic phase of development growing out of a long-term planning and implementation process being led by University City municipal government.  This process, aimed at stabilizing and revitalizing the Northeast neighborhood of the community, has included significant public investment in infrastructure, community organizing, and setting the stage for attracting developers to infill the many vacant lots in the area with new single-family infill homes.  Bywater is pleased to be working with the leadership of University City in taking the next steps in this process.  Northgate Village will produce 29 new single-family homes and townhouses—and will provide for the rehabilitation of a 1920’s mixed use building that will become a management office and community gathering space on the street level, and a two bedroom garden apartment on the second floor.  Northgate Village will create achievable future home ownership opportunities by utilizing affordable housing tax credit financing to create a lease/purchase structure that will allow residents the opportunity to affordably purchase their homes at the completion of the tax credit financing compliance period.

    Bywater is spearheading the redevelopment of the historic Charles E. Jacob Elementary School.  This redevelopment effort involves the complete historic rehabilitation of a 1930’s school building and its adaptive reuse as a 56 unit affordable senior housing development.  The school complex, vacant and abandoned since 2006, has become a symbol of neighborhood decline, and has left an entire city block in this southwestern Louisville residential neighborhood inactive.  Bywater’s plan will restore this historic resource to its former role as a community anchor, stemming the decline of the immediate area—and will provide a range of high-quality studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments for independent senior living.  The development will achieve high standards for both accessible design and sustainable development to meet the needs of residents in a holistic manner.

    Bywater is working to provide for the preservation of two neighboring senior apartment buildings that were originally developed in the mid 1990’s.  Both buildings were well-constructed, and have been well-managed and maintained.  However, upgrades are now needed to replace aging building systems, improve accessibility and energy efficiency, and ensure that current and future residents continue to have the highest quality living environment in the years to come.  Planned improvements include replacement, repairs, and updates to all building systems, updated interior finishes, significant modernization and enhancement of accessibility features, and a new focus on sustainability with the utilization of current green building systems and techniques.  The project’s development financing will enable the operating of the two formerly independent senior developments to be combined under new single ownership, and management through tax-exempt bond financing and LIHTC acquisition/rehab tax credit investment.
